| Table 1 | Gaps in Parental Characteristics and Birth Outcomes Between April- and March-born Children | tab:reg_vital_stats | task/t14.R | Source: Vital Statistics from April 2000 to March 2011. Note: We present differences in the estimated means of family background and birth outcomes between April- and March-born children (e.g. $E(Y|\mathrm{April})-E(Y|\mathrm{March})$). To do so, We regress parental characteristics and birth outcomes on age, age squared, and birth-year dummies using equation (\ref{eqn:OLS}) and estimate the gaps between April- and March-born children using equation (\ref{eqn:OLS-gap}). Occupation of household head (father if present) is reported. We say a firm is small if it hires 1-99 employees and large if it hires 100 employees or more. Standard errors are in parentheses. Because we test 15 hypotheses simultaneously, we adjust the p-values for multiple testing using the method proposed by \cite{benjamini1995controlling}, which controls for a false discovery rate.
| Table 2 | Gaps in Family Background Between April- and March-born Students | tab:reg_individual_ses_birthmonth |task/t25.R | Source: Administrative data from a municipality in Saitama that conducted the skill assessment. Note: Note: We present differences in the estimated means of family background and birth outcomes between April- and March-born children (e.g. $E(Y|\mathrm{April})-E(Y|\mathrm{March})$). To do so, we regress the family SES measures on age, age squared, and birth-year dummies using equation (\ref{eqn:OLS}) and estimate the gaps between March- and April-born children using equation (\ref{eqn:OLS-gap}). Standard errors are in parentheses. We adjust the p-values for multiple testing using the method proposed by \cite{benjamini1995controlling}, which controls for a false discovery rate, as there are three hypotheses.
