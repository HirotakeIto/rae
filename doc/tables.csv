        Note: We present differences in the estimated means of family background and birth outcomes between April- and March-born children (e.g. $E(Y|\mathrm{April})-E(Y|\mathrm{March})$). To do so, We regress parental characteristics and birth outcomes on age, age squared, and birth-year dummies using equation (\ref{eqn:OLS}) and estimate the gaps between April- and March-born children using equation (\ref{eqn:OLS-gap}). Occupation of household head (father if present) is reported. We say a firm is small if it hires 1-99 employees and large if it hires 100 employees or more. Standard errors are in parentheses. Because we test 15 hypotheses simultaneously, we adjust the p-values for multiple testing using the method proposed by \cite{benjamini1995controlling}, which controls for a false discovery rate."

    Note: Note: We present differences in the estimated means of family background and birth outcomes between April- and March-born children (e.g. $E(Y|\mathrm{April})-E(Y|\mathrm{March})$). To do so, we regress the family SES measures on age, age squared, and birth-year dummies using equation (\ref{eqn:OLS}) and estimate the gaps between March- and April-born children using equation (\ref{eqn:OLS-gap}). Standard errors are in parentheses. We adjust the p-values for multiple testing using the method proposed by \cite{benjamini1995controlling}, which controls for a false discovery rate, as there are three hypotheses."

    Note: Noncognitive skills, number of books at home, relationship with peers are available for 2016-2018. Relationship with teachers is available for 2017-2018. Weekly hours of reading, hours of playing outside and sports, and hours of arts, music, and sports are available only for 2015. All other variables are available for 2015-2018. "
 Table 4 , Month-of-Birth Gaps in Test Scores , tab:reg_math , task/t8.R ,"    Note: The gaps between the oldest and youngest students are based on equations (\ref{eqn:OLS}) and (\ref{eqn:OLS-gap}). Each estimate in the cell is obtained from a separate regression. Test scores in the regression analysis are standardized for each grade and year. The control variables include school fixed effects, survey year fixed effects, gender, and number of books at home. Our preferred model is a regression with control variables, and their estimates are reported in columns (2), (5), and (8). Standard errors are in parentheses. All estimates in this table are statistically significant at the 1\% level when p-values are adjusted for multiple testing, using a method that controls for a false discovery rate (see \cite{benjamini1995controlling}). We have 14 (6 + 6 + 2) hypotheses for each econometric specification."
 Table 5 , Month-of-Birth Gaps in Noncognitive Skills by Grade , tab:reg_noncog , task/t8.R ,"    Note: The gaps between the oldest and youngest students in a given grade are based on equations (\ref{eqn:OLS}) and (\ref{eqn:OLS-gap}). Each estimate in the cell is obtained from a separate regression. In the regression analysis, noncognitive skill measures are standardized so that the mean is 0 and standard deviation is 1 for each grade and year. The control variables include school fixed effects, survey year fixed effects, gender, and number of books at home. Standard errors are in parentheses. We adjust p-values for multiple testing of 15 hypotheses, using a method that controls for a false discovery rate (see \cite{benjamini1995controlling})."

    Note: The estimated differences between the oldest (April-born) and youngest (March-born) students in the same grade based on equations (\ref{eqn:OLS}) and (\ref{eqn:OLS-gap}) are reported. High school quality is standardized so that the mean is 50 and the standard deviation is 10. The standard errors are in parentheses."

Note: Gaps between the oldest and youngest students are reported using equations (\ref{eqn:OLS}) and (\ref{eqn:OLS-gap}). Each estimate in the cell is obtained from a separate regression. The variables Studying and Prep School are available for 2015-2018, while other dependent variables are available only for 2015. Standard errors are in parentheses. We adjust the p-values for multiple testing of 30 hypotheses, using a method that controls for a false discovery rate (see \cite{benjamini1995controlling})."
 Table 8, Month-of-Birth Effects of Relationships with Teachers and Peers , tab:reg_relationships , task/t8.R ,"    Source: Saitama Skill Assessment 2016-2018.
    
    Note: The gaps in the quality of interpersonal relationships between April- and March-born students based on equations (\ref{eqn:OLS}) and (\ref{eqn:OLS-gap}) are reported. Therefore, all values shown in each cell of the table are estimates obtained by another regression. The dependent variables are standardized for each grade and year to have a zero mean and a standard deviation of one. Control variables include school fixed effects, survey year fixed effects, gender, and number of books at home. Standard errors are in parentheses. The p-values are adjusted for multiple testing of 12 hypotheses, using a method that controls for a false discovery rate (see \cite{benjamini1995controlling})."
 Table 9, Difference Between the Province and Municipality , diff_bet_saitama_toda , task/t28.R ,"    Source: Saitama Skill Assessment 2015-2018.
    
    Note: We compare the means of the key variables for the ninth grade students in the Skill Assessment between the municipality that provided administrative data and the province that conducted the Saitama Skill Assessment. Cognitive and noncognitive skills as well as interpersonal relationships measures are standardized to have a mean of zero and a standard deviation of one for the whole province for the ninth graders. The ""Age within Grade (Months)"" column represents the relative age of the students, ranging from 0 to 11, with 0 corresponding to the youngest students and 11 to the oldest students within the same grade. The p-values are adjusted by a method that controls for a false discovery rate (see \cite{benjamini1995controlling}) because there are 16 hypotheses. "

    Note: The gaps in month-of-birth effects (based on equation \ref{eqn:OLS-gap}) between low-SES students and others are reported. We define low-SES students as those who have 0-10 books at home. The control variables include school fixed effects, survey year fixed effects, gender, and number of books at home. Standard errors are in parentheses. All but one of the estimates are statistically significant when p-values are adjusted for multiple testing, using a method that controls for a false discovery rate (see \cite{benjamini1995controlling}). The exception is the estimate for math when observations are pooled across grades (labeled as All)."
